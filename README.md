### üî≠ **Current Projects:** 
- [Time Budgetment](https://ample.contact/QA4/) ‚Äî In essence, "time is money" serves as a reminder of the inherent value of time and the importance of managing it judiciously.

In the world of business and productivity, it highlights the significance of being time-conscious and making decisions that contribute positively to one's goals and objectives.

### ‚ö° **Fun Fact:** 
* I once built a fully functional text-based adventure game using only Python? When I'm not coding, I'm often traveling and enjoying nature.
  * I've visited 15 countries and counting!
* Once, my father doubted my ability to solve Rubik's Cubes, dismissing it as a waste of time. Fueled by determination, I spent the whole night mastering the patterns and conquered it. Not only did I succeed, but I also taught my father the very next week. Now, he's a master in solving 4x4, 5x5, and even 6x6 Rubik's Cubes!
  * I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under 2 minutes.
* In my spare time, I indulge my passion for Indian cuisine, channeling my inner chef to whip up delectable dishes. 
  * Despite being born into a strictly vegetarian lifestyle, which I've maintained for the past 40 years, I thoroughly enjoy experimenting with the rich and diverse flavors of Indian cooking.
* During my initial internship at Conde Nast publication, I felt like I had landed on a completely new planet. The fast-paced environment demanded quick thinking and creative problem-solving skills, which initially felt overwhelming. However, as I adapted and gained confidence, I found myself thriving in this dynamic atmosphere. 
  * This experience unexpectedly prepared me for the fast pace of software development, where adaptability and efficiency are crucial. It taught me valuable skills like time management and collaboration, which have been instrumental in my coding journey.
