# Hello World! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Kratu Desai, a comprehensive full-stack developer and visual design enthusiast based in Austin, Texas. Founder and Dreamer-in-Chief of [DESAIGN.STUDIO](http://desaign.studio).

### 🌟 **Expertise: Proficient to Deliver Your Results**
- My core principle is simple: **Chase perfection to catch excellence**. A mantra that drives relentless growth and achievement. In my world, learning is an adventure, challenges are opportunities, and creativity knows no bounds. With every project, I embark on a journey of discovery, constantly refining my craft and pioneering new techniques that push the boundaries of possibility.

### 🔭 **Current Projects:** 
- [BudgeTime](https://budgeti.me) — In essence, "time is money" serves as a reminder of the inherent value of time and the importance of managing it judiciously. This saying underscores the notion that time, much like money, should be invested thoughtfully to yield productive and meaningful returns. In the world of business and productivity, it highlights the significance of being time-conscious and making decisions that contribute positively to one's goals and objectives.

### 🌱 **Currently Learning:** 
- I'm currently diving deeper into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Low-Code/No-Code Development, Cloud Computing and DevOps. I’m also exploring new concepts in Cybersecurity, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and Single Page Applications (SPAs). Continuous learning fuels my passion and drives my projects forward.

### ⚡ **The Fun Person Behind the Code:** 
* I once built a fully functional text-based adventure game using only Python. When I'm not coding, I'm often traveling and enjoying nature.
  * I've visited 15 countries and counting!
* Once, my father doubted my ability to solve Rubik's Cubes, dismissing it as a waste of time. Fueled by determination, I spent the whole night mastering and conquering the patterns. Not only did I succeed, but I also taught my father the very next week. Now, he's a master in solving 4x4, 5x5, and even 6x6 Rubik's Cubes!
  * I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under 2 minutes.
* In my spare time, I indulge my passion for Indian cuisine, channeling my inner chef to whip up delectable dishes. 
  * Despite being born into a strictly vegetarian lifestyle, which I've maintained for 40 years, I thoroughly enjoy experimenting with the rich and diverse flavors of Indian cooking.
* During my initial internship at Conde Nast publication, I felt like I had landed on a completely new planet. The fast-paced environment demanded quick thinking and creative problem-solving skills, which initially felt overwhelming. However, as I adapted and gained confidence, I thrived in this dynamic atmosphere. 
  * This experience unexpectedly prepared me for the fast pace of software development, where adaptability and efficiency are crucial. It taught me valuable skills like time management and collaboration, which have been instrumental in my coding journey.
* I am an ardent enthusiast of electronic gadgets, and discussing them is a favorite pastime of mine. 
  * I can easily engage in lengthy conversations about the latest innovations, functionalities, and the exciting possibilities they bring to our lives.
* Before 2024, I set a goal to learn 4-ball juggling despite already mastering the art of juggling with three balls.
